# Improvements

- Firstly I would improve the design, I didn't spend time for the design. I would use Tailwind and Tailwind UI for it. Or we can use bootstrap.
- We are not showing descriptions properly. They need to be rendered as html.
- This implementation is not responsive. I would spend some time to make it responsive.
- Months are hard coded, maybe we can only show future months.
